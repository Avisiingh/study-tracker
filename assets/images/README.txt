# Images Folder

This folder contains images for the 100-Day Study Streak Tracker project.

## Screenshot.png
Since we can't generate an actual screenshot image programmatically, you would need to:

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Take a screenshot of the application (preferably showing the main features)
3. Save it as "screenshot.png" in this folder

This screenshot will be used in the README.md to give users a visual preview of the application.
